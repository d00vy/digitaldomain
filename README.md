Hugo portfolio/blog theme. Minimal, dark, and a constant work in progress.

### Note the "constant work in progress" disclaimer!

I'm learning how to use Hugo, and this is the theme that I have created by importing my raw HTML/CSS. The original files can still be seen [here](http://github.com/d00vy/doovy.me.original) for reference.

When I feel this theme meets the requirements and is good enough for others to use, I will submit it to the [hugoThemes](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes) repository.
> As of right now, I do not feel it is ready for submission.

More documentation will come later as my work progresses.
